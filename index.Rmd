I'm a PhD Student at the Department of Political and Social Sciences of [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/phd-political-and-social-sciences/), Barcelona, where I also perform teaching duties as a Lecturer and Teaching Assistant. My research interests include policing, incarceration, identity, intersectionality, quantitative methods and causal inference.

My doctoral thesis deals with two fundamental research questions: 1) whether and how racially biased policing changes as an effect of either reforms or social movements; 2) if the intersection of race with the spectra of gender, sexuality, and disability worsens police discrimination. See my <a href="research.html">Research</a> page for more details.



I have also taught BA courses during my doctorate, both as a TA (~140 hours between courses like Introduction to Sociology, Criminality, and Research Methods Applied to Global Studies) and as a lecturer (26 hours in Introduction to Sociology). I have taught in both English and Catalan.

Before this, I obtained a [B.A.](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/PoliticalSocialInternationalSciences) and an [M.A.](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/LocalGlobalDevelopment) in the field of Political and Social Sciences from the University of Bologna, Italy. I also worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, in the Departments of Economics (2020-2021) and Languages (2022), and in an OECD project on Higher Education in Greece (2020-2021).

Outside of the academic world, I am also involved on a project, [Modena Molti Mondi](https://www.modenamoltimondi.com/), on musical education for disadvantaged high school students in my hometown, Modena (Italy), where I follow the processes of applications for funding as a Project Manager, and of impact and follow-up as well. The project was awarded funding from the Erasmus Agency in 2022 and is currently ongoing.
